# Usability Test Feedback: YADRMS BuilderUI

## Test Information
- **Date**: [TODO]
- **Test Type**: Moderated Usability Test
- **Participants**: 5 end users (mix of technical and semi-technical backgrounds)
- **Duration**: 20 minutes per session

## Test Objectives
- Evaluate the intuitiveness of the bot configuration process.
- Assess the ease of generating a client script from start to finish.
- Test the clarity and usability of the Live Testing Panel.

## Test Scenarios
1. Configure the bot with a provided token and Guild ID.
2. Select three specific modules from the checklist.
3. Save the settings and compile a new client script.
4. Navigate to the testing panel and start the newly created bot.
5. View the bot's connection log and then stop the bot.

## Key Findings

### Positive Feedback
- ✅ The overall layout is clean and the step-by-step flow is logical.
- ✅ The "Current Settings" preview card is very helpful for confirming changes.
- ✅ The separation of "Customize" and "Test" tabs is intuitive and prevents clutter.

### Areas for Improvement
- ⚠️ Users were unsure what some module names meant (e.g., "BSOD", "Ghostwriting").
- ⚠️ The "Compile" button gives no immediate visual feedback, making some users click it multiple times.
- ⚠️ Some users tried to compile before saving their settings, which failed silently at first.

## User Quotes
> "It was really easy to set up the token and pick the modules I wanted. I just wasn't sure what would happen when I clicked Compile, it looked like nothing happened for a second."

> "I love the live log viewer, but I wish I knew what 'BSOD' did without having to look it up."

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. Add tooltips with short descriptions to each module checkbox to explain its function.
2. Implement a loading state (e.g., a spinner) on the "Compile" button to provide instant feedback.

### Medium Priority
1. Add a toast notification ("Settings saved!") after the user saves their configuration to improve feedback.
2. Consider disabling the "Compile" button if settings have been changed but not saved, with a tooltip explaining why.

## Metrics
- Task Success Rate (end-to-end): 90%
- Average Time to Compile First Bot: 3.5 minutes
- User Satisfaction Score: 4.5/5

## Next Steps
1. Create tickets to implement the high-priority recommendations in the next sprint.
2. Design and write content for the module tooltips.
3. Conduct a follow-up test on the compile button's new loading state.
