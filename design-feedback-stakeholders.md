# Design Feedback: Stakeholder Interviews

## Interview Information
- **Date Range**: March 10-17, 2024
- **Format**: One-on-one interviews
- **Participants**: 6 stakeholders (2 Product Managers, 2 Technical Leads, 2 Documentation Managers)
- **Duration**: 1 hour per interview

## Design Elements Evaluated
- Visual hierarchy
- Color scheme and branding
- Typography and readability
- Layout and spacing
- Dark/light mode implementation
- Responsive design
- Interactive elements

## Key Findings

### Visual Design
#### Strengths
- ✅ Clean and professional appearance
- ✅ Consistent branding throughout
- ✅ Effective use of white space
- ✅ Good contrast in both light and dark modes

#### Areas for Improvement
- ⚠️ Code blocks could be more visually distinct
- ⚠️ Some interactive elements lack clear hover states
- ⚠️ Mobile navigation could be more compact

### Typography
#### Positive Feedback
- Font choices are professional and readable
- Code font works well for technical content
- Heading hierarchy is clear and consistent

#### Suggested Changes
1. Increase line height in long paragraphs
2. Add more weight contrast in navigation
3. Consider larger font size for mobile devices

## Stakeholder Quotes
