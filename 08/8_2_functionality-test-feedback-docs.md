# Functionality Test Feedback: YADRMS

## Test Information
- **Test Type**: End-to-End Functionality Testing
- **Participants**: 3 developers, 2 QA testers
- **Environment**: Local development environment (Windows 10, macOS)

## Test Scope
- Bot configuration via BuilderUI
- Client script generation (compilation)
- Live bot testing panel functionality
- Frontend-to-Backend API communication
- Generated client's connection to Discord

## Test Cases and Results

### Builder UI & Configuration
| Test Case | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Save Bot Token & Guild ID | ‚úÖ Pass | Settings are correctly saved to `settings.json` |
| Select/Deselect Modules | ‚úÖ Pass | Module state is correctly reflected in UI and config |
| Compile with no modules | ‚úÖ Pass | Generates a base client script successfully |
| Compile with all modules| ‚úÖ Pass | All modules are correctly included in the output script |
| EULA acceptance cookie | ‚úÖ Pass | User is redirected if EULA is not accepted |


### Backend & Client Generation
| Test Case | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| API: `/api/compile` | ‚úÖ Pass | Successfully triggers the Python builder script |
| API: `/api/save-settings`| ‚úÖ Pass | Correctly writes data to the settings file |
| Python Builder Execution| ‚úÖ Pass | Script generates a valid, runnable Python file |
| Module Code Injection | ‚úÖ Pass | `get_code()` from modules is correctly injected |
| Dependency Injection | ‚úÖ Pass | `get_dependencies()` from modules is correctly included |


### Live Testing Panel
| Test Case | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Start Bot Process | ‚úÖ Pass | Selected script starts successfully |
| Stop Bot Process | ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue | Process is killed, but logs sometimes stop updating before termination |
| View Live Logs | ‚úÖ Pass | Logs from the running bot are displayed in real-time |
| Clear Logs | ‚úÖ Pass | Log viewer is cleared successfully |


## Technical Issues Found

### Critical Issues
1. üî¥ Bot process occasionally becomes a zombie process on macOS if stopped too quickly after starting.

### Minor Issues
1. üü° Log viewer does not automatically scroll to the bottom as new logs arrive.
2. üü° No validation on Token/Guild ID format on the frontend, allowing invalid data to be saved.
3. üü° Compilation provides no feedback until it is finished; a loading spinner would be helpful.

## Performance Metrics
- Average UI load time: 0.8s
- API response time (`/compile`): 1.5s
- Average client generation time: 2.1s
- Bot connection to Discord time: ~3s

## Security Testing Results
- ‚úÖ EULA acceptance check is enforced.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No input sanitization on configuration fields (Token, Guild ID). Potential for script injection into settings file, though not directly into the Python client.
- ‚úÖ Generated client script path is secure and not user-configurable.

## Integration Testing
- ‚úÖ Frontend <-> API integration works as expected.
- ‚úÖ API <-> Python script builder integration is stable.
- ‚úÖ Generated Bot <-> Discord API connection is successful.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Investigate and fix the zombie process issue on macOS for the "Stop Bot" functionality.
2. Add frontend validation for the Bot Token and Guild ID fields.
3. Add a loading indicator to the "Compile" button to provide user feedback.

### Future Improvements
1. Implement auto-scrolling for the live log viewer.
2. Enhance the `builder.py` script to provide more granular progress updates to the frontend.

## Test Coverage
- Unit Tests (Frontend): 88%
- Integration Tests (API): 95%
- End-to-End (UI Flow): 80%

## Next Steps
1. Create tickets for the identified issues in the next sprint.
2. Prioritize the fix for the zombie process issue.
3. Plan for implementation of the "Future Improvements".
